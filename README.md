Meeting Notes
Team Meeting 2.08
WHEN: Thursday, February 8th @ 19:30
PURPOSE: First meeting, set up 
ATTENDANCE: (every team member) Andrew Huang, Keaton Xu, Hunter Long, Elizabeth Miller, and Katharine Swann (meeting was held over Zoom)

Due to scheduling conflicts we decided to meet over zoom for our first meeting, and the first thing we discussed was a regular meeting time and place for future meetings. We decided to meet every week on Saturdays at 17:30 in LEEP2.
The next item on our agenda was creating a GitHub repository. Andrew created one and shared it via email to every team member. After confirming access we moved on to designating roles.
We have a group chat over iMessage to communicate outside of classes and meetings.

ROLES:
Project Leader: Andrew Huang
Assistant Project Leader: Hunter Long
Quality Assurance Manager: Keaton Xu
Technical Lead: Elizabeth Miller
Organization/Scheduler Lead: Katharine (Katie) Swann

FUTURE:
As a group we decided it would be crucial to sit in person and review GitHub together to become familiar with the platform as well as name our team at the next meeting. In person meetings will allow for better communication and ease of shared digital work.
By the next meeting our only big objective was to formalize these notes and share them to the repository so we had them in a visible location for our TAs and professor. As the scheduler that was Katieâ€™s responsibility
We will also decide on what case we want to use snake versus camelcase for the sake of consistency in our written code.
