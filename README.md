Boolean Logic Simulator in C++

This project simulates digital logic systems in C++, throught the comprehensive definition of functionality with gates and how they handle expressions with True and False input. 

The gates that are implemented in this project are as follows:
AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR.

Functionality includes 
-Expression Parsing
-Truth Value Input
-Calculation and Output
-Error Handling
-Parenthesis Handling

Expression Parsing: 
The ability to translate expressions into code that will
